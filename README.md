This project focuses on developing an Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based pest detection system to support agriculture. The system aims to identify and classify pests, either from images or environmental data such as temperature and humidity. The project uses a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) or convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification and ensures efficient pest detection for early intervention. The ANN model achieved high accuracy in identifying pests, with potential applications in mobile farming apps, smart farming systems, and scalability for global agricultural use. This approach aims to reduce crop damage and increase farming efficiency
